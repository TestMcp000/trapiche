# PRD (Active Workspace) — <Title>

> Status: DRAFT  
> Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD  
> Owner: <name/role>  
> Scope: **active PRD workspace only** (not a long-lived proposal; do not treat as SSoT)

This file is the default input for `doc/meta/AGENT_PROMPT__STEP_PLAN.md` → output `doc/meta/STEP_PLAN.md`.

When this PRD becomes stable/approved, rename it to a descriptive proposal file in `doc/specs/completed/` (or start a fresh doc from `doc/specs/completed/TEMPLATE.md`) and keep this file as the “active workspace” if needed.
